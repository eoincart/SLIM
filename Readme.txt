Repository for SLIM code and experiments
This repository is to be used for SLIM code and experiments associated with the paper entitled "Side-Length Independent Motif (SLIM): Motif discovery and volatility analysis in time series - SAX, MDL and the Matrix Profile".
Initial code is a work in progress, an updated and tidied version will be made available shortly.

Please note paths to relevant input folders and external code below need to be updated as these will vary depnding on where you have downloaded these scripts to.
